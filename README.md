# Monica P. Mendoza Personal Website

This is a simple, minimal GitHub Pages-ready personal site. Customize the content in `index.html` and upload to a repository named `yourusername.github.io` to publish.

## Domain Setup (monicapmendoza.com)

1. Add a CNAME file containing:
   monicapmendoza.com

2. Configure DNS at your domain registrar:
   - A Records (for apex/root domain):
     - 185.199.108.153
     - 185.199.109.153
     - 185.199.110.153
     - 185.199.111.153
   - CNAME Record (for www):
     - www â†’ yourusername.github.io

Then commit and push the site to GitHub. Done!
