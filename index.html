      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and PhD student in biomedical engineering at Columbia University, with a focus on immunoengineering and DNA nanotechnology.
    I draw on two decades of leadership in tech and the nonprofit world to inform my approach to scientific research.
    Trained in molecular biology, cellular assays, and in vivo models—with a foundation in bioengineering from UC Berkeley—I’m especially drawn to work at the intersection of biology, engineering, and computation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I can learn quickly, take ownership of complex systems, and contribute to bold, long-term goals.
    Whether building scalable solutions, mentoring emerging leaders, or working at the bench, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a cross-disciplinary approach to problem-solving.
